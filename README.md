## Read this before you depend on this package

One thing is deliberately not glossed over.

### The *verified* range ends at 2084 BS (12 April 2028)

The Bikram Sambat calendar's month lengths are set **astronomically** — by the
moment the sun crosses into each zodiac sign — and published year by year in
the Nepali Panchanga. This package ships the years it could **verify against two
independent sources**: **1975–2084 BS (1918-04-13 – 2028-04-12 AD)**. By default,
dates outside that range raise `DateOutOfRange` rather than guessing.

**Two kinds of verified, and the difference is worth knowing.** The calendar is
determined by the [Nepal Panchanga Nirnayak Samiti](https://npns.gov.np/), a
government body under the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, which
approves each year's patro a few months before that year begins. It has
published **through 2083**.

| Years | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 1975–2083 | two independent sources, both deriving from an **already-published** Panchanga |
| 2084 | two independent sources that are both **projecting** — no official patro exists yet |

2084 meets this package's stated bar and is shipped on it, but it is not attested
by the almanac, because the almanac has not been written. Its official
determination is expected around **Magh 2083 (January–February 2027)**; the row
is flagged in `calendar_data.py` to be re-confirmed then.

This is also why **2085 is not in the table even though two sources agree on it**.
Hamro Patro and `nepali-datetime` match exactly on all twelve months of 2085 —
but the Samiti has not determined that year, so both are necessarily projecting,
and agreement between projections is not attestation. Note also that Hamro Patro,
though Nepal's most widely used calendar, is a private company that *follows* the
Samiti rather than constituting it.

They *can* be approximated by computation — but not exactly, and that gap is the
whole point. A Surya-Siddhanta model of the sun (the same reckoning the official
calendar uses) reproduces the verified years to only **~87% of months, the
rest off by exactly one day, and just 58 of 110 years fully correct** (re-run it
yourself: `python -c "from django_bikram_sambat.predict import validate; print(validate())"`).
The residual is the traditional day-boundary rule plus the committee's occasional
manual corrections — real, and not tunable away. So computed years are shipped as
a clearly-marked **provisional** tier, never as fact.

If April 2028 is too close for you (it is, for anything long-lived), you have
two honest options — see [Living past 2084](#living-past-2084).

## Installation

```bash
pip install django-bikram-sambat          # core + Django integration
pip install django-bikram-sambat[drf]     # also pulls in djangorestframework
```

Requires Python 3.10+. Django is only needed for `django_bikram_sambat.django`; the core
`BSDate` type has **no dependencies at all**.

---

## The design decision that matters

**`BSDateField` stores a native `date` (Gregorian/AD) in the database and
exposes a `BSDate` in Python.** Conversion happens at the boundary, and only
there.

Most Nepali date libraries store BS as a string (`"2081-01-01"`) or as three
integer columns. Both throw away everything the database is for:

| | native `date` (this package) | BS string | y/m/d integers |
|---|---|---|---|
| btree index on ranges | ✅ | ❌ equality/prefix only | ⚠️ composite, no range seek |
| `__gte` / `__lt` / `__range` | ✅ plain comparison | ❌ wrong across month lengths | ⚠️ OR-of-ANDs |
| `ORDER BY` | ✅ | ❌ | ⚠️ 3-column sort |
| `Min` / `Max` / aggregates | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| `TruncMonth`, `ExtractYear`, date_trunc | ✅ *(on the AD value — see below)* | ❌ | ❌ |
| readable from psql / BI tools | ✅ | ⚠️ | ❌ |

A BS string does not sort chronologically in a way the database understands,
and no index can fix that. Because `BSDateField` subclasses
`models.DateField`, every lookup Django already ships keeps working — there is
nothing to reimplement.

### The one consequence to know

Every database-side date operation is **inherited from `DateField` and works on
the stored Gregorian value**, because that is genuinely what the column holds.

```python
Invoice.objects.filter(issued_on__year=2024)   # AD year — 1 Baishakh 2081 matches
Invoice.objects.filter(issued_on__year=2081)   # matches nothing
```

`ExtractYear` is the same story and says so out loud — it returns `2024`, a
plain integer nobody will mistake for a BS year.

**`TruncMonth` and `TruncYear` are the one case that does not announce itself,
so it is worth stating plainly.** They truncate to the start of the *AD* month
or year, which falls in the middle of a BS one; the result then converts back
through this field and arrives as a `BSDate` that is not a BS period start:

```python
Invoice.objects.annotate(m=TruncMonth("issued_on"))   # 1 Baishakh 2081 →
                                                      # BSDate(2080, 12, 19)
Invoice.objects.annotate(y=TruncYear("issued_on"))    # → BSDate(2080, 9, 16)
```

That is a correct AD truncation and a meaningless BS bucket. To group by Bikram
Sambat periods, aggregate per range with the helpers below, or bucket in Python:

```python
start, end = bs_month_bounds(2081, 1)
Invoice.objects.filter(issued_on__gte=start, issued_on__lt=end).aggregate(Sum("total"))
```

All of this is documented, tested, and intentional. For BS years, read on.

---

## Querying by BS year or month

There is **no `__bs_year` lookup**, on purpose.

The database has no BS calendar table, so evaluating a BS year in SQL requires
either inlining a 109-branch `CASE` expression (correct, but opaque to the
planner — every query becomes a sequential scan, quietly making your tables
slow), or a stored generated column (a schema decision that belongs to your
application, not to a field type). A third option — rewriting equality into a
range, as Django's own `YearExact` does — works for `__bs_year=2081` but not
for `__bs_year__gt`, `values()`, `annotate()` or `order_by()`, which would make
the transform correct in some positions and wrong in others.

A lookup that is only sometimes safe is worse than no lookup. So the package
ships helpers instead — a BS year *is* a contiguous span of AD dates, and
saying so directly keeps the index in play:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django.lookups import bs_year_q, bs_month_q, bs_year_bounds

Invoice.objects.filter(bs_year_q("issued_on", 2081))
Invoice.objects.filter(bs_month_q("issued_on", 2081, 1))
Invoice.objects.filter(bs_year_q("issued_on", 2081), status="paid")
Invoice.objects.exclude(bs_year_q("issued_on", 2081))

bs_year_bounds(2081)   # (date(2024, 4, 13), date(2025, 4, 14)) — half-open
```

These compile to `issued_on >= %s AND issued_on < %s`: one index range scan, no
per-row work.

---

## Fiscal year

Nepal's fiscal year (आर्थिक वर्ष) runs **1 Shrawan to the last day of Ashadh**,
and is named for the year it starts in: **FY 2081/82**.

```python
d = BSDate(2082, 1, 1)          # Baishakh — the *closing* quarter of FY 2081/82

d.fiscal_year                   # 2081
d.fiscal_year_label             # '2081/82'
d.fiscal_quarter                # 4
```

Because a fiscal year spans two BS years, no combination of built-in lookups
expresses it — so it gets the same half-open range treatment as a BS year:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django.lookups import bs_fiscal_year_q, bs_fiscal_quarter_q
from django_bikram_sambat.fiscal import fiscal_year_bounds

Invoice.objects.filter(bs_fiscal_year_q("issued_on", 2081))
Invoice.objects.filter(bs_fiscal_quarter_q("issued_on", 2081, 1))

fiscal_year_bounds(2081)   # (date(2024, 7, 16), date(2025, 7, 17)) — half-open
```

Quarters are the fiscal year cut into three-month blocks: Q1 Shrawan–Ashwin,
Q2 Kartik–Poush, Q3 Magh–Chaitra, Q4 Baishakh–Ashadh. **Q4 carries the higher BS
year** — Baishakh 2082 belongs to FY 2081/82, not FY 2082/83. That is the part
everyone gets wrong, so it is checked day by day in the test suite.

Note that `fiscal_year_bounds(2084)` raises: a fiscal year reaches into the next
BS year, so it runs out one year before the calendar table does.

---

## `BSDate`

Immutable (`__slots__`), hashable, totally ordered, and shaped like
`datetime.date` so there is little new to learn.

```python
d = BSDate(2081, 1, 1)

d.year, d.month, d.day        # 2081, 1, 1
d.to_ad()                     # datetime.date(2024, 4, 13)
d.weekday()                   # 5 — Monday==0, like datetime
d.nepali_weekday()            # 6 — Sunday==0, like a printed Nepali calendar
d.isoformat()                 # '2081-01-01'  (BS components)
d.replace(month=2)            # BSDate(2081, 2, 1)
d.days_in_month               # 31  (months run 29–32 days)

d + datetime.timedelta(days=31)     # BSDate(2081, 2, 1)
BSDate(2081, 2, 1) - d              # datetime.timedelta(days=31)

BSDate.today()
BSDate.from_ad(datetime.date(2024, 4, 13))
BSDate.fromisoformat("2081-01-01")
BSDate.strptime("01 Baishakh 2081", "%d %B %Y")
```

A few deliberate choices:

- **`BSDate != datetime.date`, always**, even for the same day. Silently
  equating them would make dict keys and set membership ambiguous. Convert
  explicitly.
- **Sub-day timedeltas are rejected**, not truncated — the rounding direction
  is a coin flip callers shouldn't have to guess.
- **`replace(year=...)` can raise.** 2081 Jestha has 32 days; 2082 Jestha has
  31. There is no 32nd to land on, so it fails instead of clamping.

### Errors

```
BikramError
└── InvalidBSDate      (also a ValueError)
    └── DateOutOfRange
```

`InvalidBSDate` subclasses `ValueError` so existing `except ValueError` blocks
keep working, while `except BikramError` catches exactly this package.

```python
BSDate(2081, 1, 32)   # InvalidBSDate: day 32 is out of range for 2081-01, which has 31 days
BSDate(2090, 1, 1)    # DateOutOfRange: BS year 2090 is outside the verified range 1975..2084
```

---

## Formatting

Language and numerals are **independent** switches, because real Nepali
documents mix them freely.

```python
d.strftime("%d %B %Y")                                    # '01 Baishakh 2081'
d.strftime("%d %B %Y", lang="ne")                         # '01 वैशाख 2081'
d.strftime("%d %B %Y", numerals="devanagari")             # '०१ Baishakh २०८१'
d.strftime("%A, %d %B %Y", lang="ne", numerals="devanagari")  # 'शनिबार, ०१ वैशाख २०८१'
```

| Directive | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `%Y` `%y` | Year (4-digit / 2-digit) |
| `%m` `%-m` | Month, padded / unpadded |
| `%d` `%-d` | Day, padded / unpadded |
| `%B` `%b` | Month name, full / abbreviated |
| `%A` `%a` | Weekday name, full / abbreviated |
| `%j` | Day of year |
| `%%` | Literal `%` |

Parsing accepts either numeral system by default (`numerals="auto"`):

```python
from django_bikram_sambat import parse_bs
parse_bs("२०८१-०१-०१", "%Y-%m-%d")        # (2081, 1, 1)
parse_bs("०१ वैशाख २०८१", "%d %B %Y", lang="ne")
```

`%y` is ambiguous on input — the range spans 109 years, so `75`–`83` match both
19xx and 20xx. It resolves toward 20xx and is documented as such. Prefer `%Y`.

---

## Django integration

### Model field

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django import BSDateField

class Invoice(models.Model):
    issued_on  = BSDateField(db_index=True)
    due_on     = BSDateField(null=True, blank=True)
    created_on = BSDateField(auto_now_add=True)   # yields a BSDate
```

Assignment accepts, with fixed meanings:

| Input | Read as |
|---|---|
| `BSDate(2081, 1, 1)` | itself |
| `datetime.date(2024, 4, 13)` | **Gregorian**, converted |
| `"2081-01-01"` | **Bikram Sambat** |

The asymmetry is deliberate: a `datetime.date` is unambiguously Gregorian,
while a string in this field's context is the BS value a user typed. `dumpdata`
emits BS strings, and `loaddata` reads them back.

`default=BSDate(2081, 1, 1)` works — a migration serializer is registered.

### Forms

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django.forms import BSDateField, BSDateInput

class InvoiceForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model, fields = Invoice, ["issued_on"]
        widgets = {"issued_on": BSDateInput(format="%d %B %Y", lang="ne",
                                            numerals="devanagari")}
```

The widget is a plain text input, not `<input type="date">` — the browser's
native picker only speaks Gregorian and would rewrite the value. It emits a
`data-bs-date="2081-01-01"` attribute for JS date pickers to hook.

In the **Django admin**, `BSDateField` would otherwise inherit `AdminDateWidget`
(admin maps `models.DateField` to it by walking the MRO), whose `vDateField`
class binds Django's *Gregorian* calendar popup and a "Today" button writing the
Gregorian date. `formfield()` swaps that widget out. Widgets you choose yourself
are left alone.

### Admin list filters

The same MRO lookup gives `BSDateField` Django's Gregorian `DateFieldListFilter`.
**Do not use it on this field — every bucket returns zero rows.**

A list filter round-trips its bounds through the query string, so they come back
as ISO strings, and a string in this field's context is a *Bikram Sambat* value
(that is the documented contract). The Gregorian bound `2026-07-17` is therefore
re-read as 2026-07-17 **BS** — 1969 AD — and matches nothing. "Today" on a row
saved today returns nothing, on every supported Django version. The labels are
wrong too: "This month" means the *Gregorian* month, which spans two BS months
and, in mid-July, two fiscal years.

Use the BS-aware filter instead. It offers *Today*, *Past 7 days*, *This month*,
*This year* and *This fiscal year*, each a half-open range on the indexed column,
and it parses its own bounds back as Gregorian so the buckets actually select:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django.admin import BSDateFieldListFilter

class InvoiceAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_filter = [("issued_on", BSDateFieldListFilter)]
```

Or make it the default for every `BSDateField` in the project:

```python
class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    def ready(self):
        from django_bikram_sambat.django.admin import register_list_filter
        register_list_filter()
```

⚠️ **`date_hierarchy` is not covered.** It is rendered by a Django template tag
that builds `__year`/`__month`/`__day` directly, with no registry to hook — so it
drills down by **AD**, showing a 1 Baishakh 2081 record under "2024". Prefer the
filter above.

### Date picker

```python
# settings.py — required for the picker only; the rest of the package
# needs no app registration.
INSTALLED_APPS = [..., "django_bikram_sambat"]
```

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django import BSDatePickerInput

widgets = {"issued_on": BSDatePickerInput(lang="ne", numerals="devanagari")}
```

A Bikram Sambat calendar in 13 kB of vanilla JavaScript (4 kB gzipped), plus
2.8 kB of CSS — **no npm, no build
step, no CDN, and no new dependency**. The verified calendar is compiled into the
asset as a 1.3 kB string, so the browser does real BS arithmetic rather than
asking the server on every click; a test asserts that copy still equals the
Python table, and the two agree on all 40,178 dates in the range.

It is progressive enhancement: the field is the same text input underneath, so it
works with JavaScript off, and every value the picker writes is re-validated
server-side exactly like typed input. Needs `django.contrib.staticfiles` and
`{{ form.media }}` in your template; inside the admin both are already handled.

### DRF

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.django.drf import BSDateField

class InvoiceSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    issued_on = BSDateField()
    class Meta:
        model, fields = Invoice, ["id", "issued_on"]
```

⚠️ **If you use `ModelSerializer` without declaring the field explicitly**, DRF
resolves `BSDateField` to its own `DateField` (since it subclasses
`models.DateField`) and emits **Gregorian** dates — plausible-looking output in
the wrong calendar. Close that trap once at startup:

```python
class MyAppConfig(AppConfig):
    def ready(self):
        from django_bikram_sambat.django.drf import register_serializer_field
        register_serializer_field()
```

It isn't done on import, because mutating a third-party class as an import side
effect makes test suites order-dependent.

## Calendar data: provenance and verified range

**Where the table came from.** It was not authored by hand or generated. It was
extracted and cross-verified from two independently maintained, MIT-licensed
sources:

1. [`nepali-datetime`](https://pypi.org/project/nepali-datetime/) 1.0.8.5 —
   `nepali_datetime/data/calendar_bs.csv`
2. [`bikram-sambat`](https://pypi.org/project/bikram-sambat/) 0.2.0 —
   `bikram_sambat/data/calendar_data.py`

Both ultimately derive from the Nepali Panchanga. Month lengths are facts, not
authorship; the implementations here are original.

**Core verified range: 1975–2083 BS (1918-04-13 – 2027-04-13 AD).** Across those
109 years the two sources agree on **all 1,308 month lengths**, and:

- every year totals 365 or 366 days;
- every month is 29–32 days;
- all 39,813 dates round-trip (`from_ad(to_ad(d)) == d`);
- consecutive BS days advance the AD weekday by exactly one, with no gaps;
- derived anchors match independently published values:
  - 1 Baishakh **1975** BS = 13 April 1918
  - 1 Baishakh **2000** BS = **14 April 1943**
  - 1 Baishakh **2081** BS = 13 April 2024
  - 1 Baishakh **2082** BS = 14 April 2025

> Note on the 2000 BS anchor: it is often quoted as *13* April 1943. That is
> off by one. Both upstream libraries, and public converters, place it at **14
> April 1943**, and the whole 1975–2083 chain is self-consistent only with that
> value.

**2084 BS was added later (July 2026)** from a different independent pair:
scraped from hamropatro.com and found identical to `nepali-datetime` for all
twelve months (those two disagree with `bikram-sambat` there, so Hamro Patro
breaks the tie). It chains exactly onto 2083 and extends the verified range to
**12 April 2028**. It is the first year with a `(30, 30, 30)` tail — corroborated
by both sources, but worth re-confirming against the official Panchanga.

**Why it stops at 2084** — it stops where the evidence stops, not where the
sources stop:

- `nepali-datetime` carries rows to 2100 BS, but from 2085 they are visibly
  synthetic: 14 of its 17 remaining years end in the tail `(30, 30, 30)`, and
  **2096 BS sums to 364 days**, which is not a possible year. (2084 itself
  checked out against Hamro Patro; 2085 onward has no such corroboration.)
- `bikram-sambat` carries 1901–2199 BS, but outside 1975–2084 nothing here
  corroborates it.
- The two diverge from 2084 onward and never re-converge.

Data below 1975 BS (available from `bikram-sambat` alone) is excluded for the
same reason: single-source and unverified.

---

## Living past 2084

April 2028 is the current edge. Two honest ways forward, and one that is not on
offer.

### Not on offer: a "100-year table" of verified dates

There isn't one — anywhere. Nobody has authoritative month lengths for
2085 BS onward, because the Panchanga committee sets them astronomically and
publishes roughly a year ahead. Every file that claims a century of BS dates is
either computed (a prediction) or filler (the `nepali-datetime` rows past 2084
include a **364-day year**). This package will not pretend otherwise.

### Option A — extend the verified table as data is published

When the Samiti publishes further years:

1. Append the rows to `VERIFIED_BS_MONTH_DAYS` in
   `django_bikram_sambat/calendar_data.py` and raise `VERIFIED_MAX_BS_YEAR`.
2. Corroborate each new year against **at least two independent sources**.
3. Run the suite — `tests/test_calendar_data.py` enforces the 365/366 total,
   the 29–32 month bound, and the anti-filler tail check;
   `tests/test_convert.py` re-verifies round-trips and weekday continuity.

This is the real fix. The provisional tier is a bridge to it, not a replacement.

**Turning a source into a table.** Step 2 needs a second opinion in a comparable
shape. `month_lengths_from_csv()` derives month lengths from any per-day CSV —
a published Panchanga you transcribed, an internal dataset, a scrape — using
only the standard library:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.sources import month_lengths_from_csv
from django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data import VERIFIED_BS_MONTH_DAYS

table = month_lengths_from_csv("calendar.csv")     # {2085: (31, 31, 32, ...), ...}

# Where the file overlaps the verified range, it must agree exactly.
for year, lengths in table.items():
    known = VERIFIED_BS_MONTH_DAYS.get(year)
    if known and known != lengths:
        print(f"{year}: source says {lengths}, table says {known}")
```

The file needs a `bs_date` column (or `bs_year`/`bs_month`/`bs_day`) and an ISO
`ad_date`; extra columns are ignored. Only complete years are returned, and the
Gregorian column is checked — every consecutive BS day must advance the AD date
by exactly one, which is what catches a truncated fetch or a mis-parsed row that
the BS numbering alone would hide.

**This package never fetches anything.** Gather the data out of band and hand
over the file. A date library that makes network calls turns every request cycle
into somewhere your application can fail, and an HTML parser that breaks quietly
produces plausible wrong dates — the one outcome this package exists to prevent.

Past the verified range the same function feeds
[Option B](#option-b--enable-computed-provisional-years-now): slice the result to
a contiguous run starting at 2085 and pass it to `install_provisional()`. It
stays flagged provisional, because one source is one source.

### Option B — enable computed (provisional) years now

If you need dates past 2027 today and can accept that a predicted month length
is right about **seven times in eight** (±1 day otherwise), opt in:

```bash
# import-time, framework-agnostic — the safe way
export DJANGO_BIKRAM_PROVISIONAL_THROUGH_YEAR=2183
```

Now `BSDate(2100, 1, 1)` works instead of raising. Every such date is **flagged**:

```python
BSDate(2100, 1, 1).is_verified          # False
# constructing or converting it raises ProvisionalDateWarning (once, by default)
```

Prefer to generate the numbers yourself, or wire them in from your own startup
code? The predictor is a plain module:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.predict import build_provisional_table, validate

validate()                       # the honest backtest: ~87% of months, ±1 day
table = build_provisional_table(through_year=2183)   # {2084: (...), ... 2183: (...)}

from django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data import install_provisional
install_provisional(table)       # call once at startup, before the first date op
```

The model is Surya-Siddhanta solar longitude crossed against the sidereal signs,
with two constants fit to the verified range. It is documented in
`django_bikram_sambat/predict.py`, caveats and all. **Do not use provisional dates where
a one-day error matters** (due dates, legal deadlines); do use them for planning
and display, and replace them with verified rows the moment they publish.

**A second source, if you prefer it.** `bikram-sambat` (MIT) ships its own table
to 2199 BS. Install `django-bikram-sambat[bikram-sambat]` and use it in place of the
predictor:

```python
from django_bikram_sambat.sources import bikram_sambat_table
from django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data import install_provisional
install_provisional(bikram_sambat_table(through_year=2150))
```

Be clear-eyed: this is still **one unverified source**, no more authoritative
than the predictor — they disagree on every year past 2084, and neither is the
official Panchanga. It is offered only so you can choose which best-guess to run.

To silence or harden the warning globally:

```python
import warnings
from django_bikram_sambat import ProvisionalDateWarning
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=ProvisionalDateWarning)  # quiet
warnings.filterwarnings("error",  category=ProvisionalDateWarning)  # strict again
```

## Migrating from another package

Coming from `django-nepali-datetime-field`, `django-npdt`, or hand-rolled
string/integer storage? See **[docs/migrating.md](https://github.com/anishbhimgc/django-bikram-sambat/blob/main/docs/migrating.md)**.

If you are on `django-nepali-datetime-field` the storage is already compatible —
it is a field swap with **no data migration**.

## Deliberately out of scope

- **BS time/datetime types.** The calendar defines days, not clocks. Use a
  normal `DateTimeField` for instants.
- **`__bs_year` / `__bs_month` transforms.** See above.
- **Holiday calendars and Panchanga tithi.** Different problems with different
  data sources, and neither is derivable from month lengths.
