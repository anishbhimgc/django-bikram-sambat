"""Bidirectional conversion between Bikram Sambat and Gregorian dates.

Both directions are day-offset arithmetic from the single anchor defined in
:mod:`django_bikram.calendar_data`: a BS date is turned into "days since the anchor",
which the Gregorian side already knows how to handle via
:class:`datetime.timedelta`.

Cost
----
A cumulative day count per year is built once at import (109 additions) and
cached in :data:`_YEAR_START_OFFSET`. That makes conversion cheap and, more
importantly, independent of how far the date is from the anchor:

* :func:`bs_to_ad` -- ``O(months_in_year)``, i.e. at most 12 additions.
* :func:`ad_to_bs` -- ``O(log years)`` to locate the year by binary search,
  then at most 12 additions to locate the month.

Neither walks day by day, so a date in 2083 BS costs the same as one in 1975.
