"""Django model field for Bikram Sambat dates.

The whole design rests on one decision, stated here because everything else
follows from it:

**The column is a native ``date`` holding the Gregorian (AD) value; Python sees
a** :class:`~django_bikram.date.BSDate` **. Conversion happens only at the boundary.**

The alternative -- storing ``"2081-01-01"`` as text, or splitting into
``year``/``month``/``day`` integer columns -- looks simpler for about a day and
then quietly costs you everything the database is for:

* **Indexes.** A btree on a real ``date`` answers ranges; a btree on a BS text
  column only answers equality and prefix, because BS text does not sort
  chronologically across the varying month lengths. Split integer columns need
  a composite index and still cannot express "between these two dates" in one
  seek.
* **Range queries.** ``__gte`` / ``__lt`` / ``__range`` are ordinary
  comparisons on a ``date``. On split columns they become an OR-of-ANDs across
  three columns that no planner enjoys.
* **Aggregation and ordering.** ``Min``, ``Max``, ``ORDER BY`` and window
  functions work because ``date`` has a total order in SQL.
* **DB-side date functions.** ``TruncMonth``, ``ExtractYear``, date_trunc, age
  arithmetic -- all of it stays available.
* **Interoperability.** Reports, BI tools, ``psql``, and any non-Python
  consumer see a normal date column.

Because :class:`BSDateField` subclasses :class:`~django.db.models.DateField`,
every lookup Django already implements for dates keeps working, and values are
converted through :meth:`BSDateField.get_prep_value` on the way down.

The one thing to know is that every database-side date operation works on the
**stored Gregorian** value, because that is genuinely what the column contains:

* ``__year`` / ``__month`` / ``__day`` filter on the AD components. See
  :mod:`django_bikram.django.lookups` for the BS-year equivalent and why it is a
  helper rather than a lookup.
* ``ExtractYear`` and friends return the AD number -- ``2024``, not ``2081``.
* ``TruncMonth`` / ``TruncYear`` truncate to the start of the **AD** month or
  year, which is a day in the middle of a BS one. Because their ``output_field``
  is this field, the result is then converted back and arrives as a
  :class:`BSDate` that is *not* a BS month or year start:
  ``TruncMonth`` over 1 Baishakh 2081 yields ``BSDate(2080, 12, 19)``. Group by
  Bikram Sambat periods with the range helpers in
  :mod:`django_bikram.django.lookups` instead, or bucket in Python.
