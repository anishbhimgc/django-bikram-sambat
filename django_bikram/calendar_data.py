"""Bikram Sambat calendar data: year -> month lengths, plus the AD anchor.

This module is the entire correctness surface of the package. Every conversion
is arithmetic over :data:`BS_MONTH_DAYS` from a single anchor, so an error here
is an error everywhere.

Provenance
----------
The month-length table was **not** authored by hand. It was extracted and
cross-verified from two independently maintained, MIT-licensed sources:

1. ``nepali-datetime`` 1.0.8.5 -- ``nepali_datetime/data/calendar_bs.csv``
2. ``bikram-sambat`` 0.2.0 -- ``bikram_sambat/data/calendar_data.py``

Both ultimately derive from the Nepali Panchanga (the official almanac
published by the Nepal Panchanga Nirnayak Samiti). Month lengths are decided
astronomically -- by the moment the sun crosses into each zodiac sign -- so
they cannot be computed from a rule and must come from published tables.

Verified range: **1975-01-01 BS through 2084-12-30 BS**
(1918-04-13 AD through 2028-04-12 AD).

For 1975-2083 (109 years) the two sources above agree on all 1,308 month
lengths, every year totals 365 or 366 days, every month is 29-32 days, and the
derived anchors reproduce independently attested dates (see ``ANCHOR_AD``).

**2084** was added later (2026-07) from a different independent pair: scraped
from hamropatro.com and found identical to ``nepali-datetime`` for all twelve
months. Those two disagree with ``bikram-sambat`` on 2084, so Hamro Patro breaks
the tie; 2084 chains exactly onto 2083 (1 Baishakh 2084 = 2027-04-14). It is the
first year with a ``(30, 30, 30)`` tail -- corroborated by both sources, but
worth re-confirming against the official Panchanga once it publishes.

Why the range stops at 2084 BS
------------------------------
It stops where the evidence stops, not where the sources stop. 2084 itself was
confirmed against Hamro Patro (see above); from 2085 on there is no such check:

* ``nepali-datetime`` carries rows through 2100 BS, but from 2085 BS onward
  they are visibly synthetic: 14 of its remaining years end in the tail
  ``(30, 30, 30)``, and **2096 BS sums to 364 days** -- an impossible year.
* ``bikram-sambat`` carries rows from 1901 to 2199 BS, but outside 1975-2084
  it has no corroborating source here.
* The two tables diverge from 2085 BS onward and never re-converge.

Extrapolated data would be silently wrong rather than loudly absent, so by
default dates outside the verified range raise
:class:`~django_bikram.exceptions.DateOutOfRange`.

Two tiers: verified and provisional
-----------------------------------
The data is split so that "attested" and "computed" never blur together:

* :data:`VERIFIED_BS_MONTH_DAYS` -- the two-source table above, the default and
  the correctness core.
* :data:`PROVISIONAL_BS_MONTH_DAYS` -- **empty by default**. A place for
  *computed* years produced by :mod:`django_bikram.predict`, for projects that
  must keep working past the verified horizon and can accept that a predicted
  month length is right about seven times in eight (see that module's
  ``validate()``). Opt in by setting the :data:`PROVISIONAL_ENV_VAR` environment
  variable, or by calling :func:`install_provisional` at startup.

:data:`BS_MONTH_DAYS` is the merged working table the conversion code runs over.
:func:`is_verified_year` and :attr:`django_bikram.date.BSDate.is_verified` report
which tier a date came from, and using a provisional date raises
:class:`~django_bikram.exceptions.ProvisionalDateWarning`.

Extending the *verified* table
------------------------------
When the Panchanga Nirnayak Samiti publishes further years, append the rows to
:data:`VERIFIED_BS_MONTH_DAYS` and raise :data:`VERIFIED_MAX_BS_YEAR`.
Corroborate each new year against at least two independent sources and check
that it totals 365 or 366 days; ``tests/test_calendar_data.py`` enforces the
invariants. Moving a year from predicted to verified is the goal; the predictor
is a stopgap, never a substitute.

    This is the one supported way to make the package accept dates past the

    :func:`django_bikram.predict.build_provisional_table` -- to
    :data:`PROVISIONAL_BS_MONTH_DAYS`, rebuilds the merged
    :data:`BS_MONTH_DAYS`, extends :data:`MAX_BS_YEAR` / :data:`MAX_AD_DATE`, and

    :attr:`~django_bikram.date.BSDate.max` bound.

    **Run it once, at startup, before the first date operation, and not
    concurrently with any conversion.** It mutates process-global tables in
    place (validating fully first, so a bad table never half-applies), but a
    thread converting a date during the mutation could momentarily see a partial
    table. The easiest way is not to call it at all but to set the
    :data:`PROVISIONAL_ENV_VAR` environment variable, which triggers exactly this
    at import -- the point at which it is unambiguously safe. Installed years
    remain flagged: constructing or converting one raises
