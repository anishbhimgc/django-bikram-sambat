"""Nepali fiscal year and quarter arithmetic.

The rule under test is that the fiscal year runs 1 Shrawan to the last day of
Ashadh and is named for the year it starts in. Everything else -- quarters,
bounds, the ORM helpers -- is derived from that, so the tests here lean on
exhaustive day-by-day checks rather than on hand-picked examples.
