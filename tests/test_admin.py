"""The Bikram Sambat aware admin ``list_filter``.

Django resolves a field's list filter with ``isinstance(f, models.DateField)``,
which ``BSDateField`` satisfies -- so without this filter the admin offers
buckets labelled "This month" and "This year" that are silently *Gregorian*
periods. The tests below pin both halves: that Django's default really is wrong
for this field, and that ours really is right.
