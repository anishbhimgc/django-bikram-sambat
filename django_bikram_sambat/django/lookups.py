"""Index-friendly helpers for querying by Bikram Sambat year and month.

Why there is no ``__bs_year`` lookup
------------------------------------

The obvious feature request is ``Invoice.objects.filter(issued_on__bs_year=2081)``.
It is not implemented here, on purpose.

The column holds a Gregorian ``date``. To evaluate a BS year in SQL the
database would need the BS calendar table, which it does not have. There are
three ways to give it one, and none is worth shipping:

1. **Inline the table into the query.** A ``CASE WHEN issued_on BETWEEN … THEN
   2081 …`` expression with one branch per BS year. Correct, but the expression
   is opaque to the planner: it cannot use the btree index on ``issued_on``, so
   every query degrades to a sequential scan plus 109 comparisons per row. It
   would look convenient and quietly make tables slow -- the exact trade this
   package exists to avoid.
2. **Add a stored generated column** (plus an index, plus a migration, plus a
   backfill, plus a rebuild every time the calendar table is extended). That is
   a schema decision belonging to the application, not something a field type
   should impose.
3. **Rewrite equality into a range**, the way Django's own ``YearExact`` lookup
   does. This works for ``__bs_year=2081`` but not for ``__bs_year__gt=2081``
   or for ``__bs_year`` in ``values()``, ``annotate()``, ``order_by()`` or
   aggregation -- so the transform would be correct in some positions and
   wrong or slow in others. A lookup that is only sometimes safe is worse than
   no lookup.

The honest alternative is a half-open range on the indexed column, which is
what a BS year *is*: a contiguous span of AD dates. The helpers below build
those ranges, so the query stays a plain indexed range scan::

    from django_bikram_sambat.django.lookups import bs_year_q, bs_month_q

    Invoice.objects.filter(bs_year_q("issued_on", 2081))
    Invoice.objects.filter(bs_month_q("issued_on", 2081, 1))

Both compile to ``issued_on >= %s AND issued_on < %s`` -- one index range scan,
no per-row work, and it composes with ``Q`` objects, ``exclude()``, ``select
_related`` and everything else as normal.

Grouping by BS year in the database (the ``TruncYear`` equivalent) has the same
problem and the same answer: aggregate per range, or annotate in Python.
