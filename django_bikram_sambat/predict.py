"""Astronomical *prediction* of Bikram Sambat month lengths -- **provisional**.

Read this before using anything here.
=====================================

The verified table (:mod:`django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data`) stops at
:data:`~django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data.VERIFIED_MAX_BS_YEAR` BS because that is
where two independent published sources still agree. Beyond it, month lengths
are *not published yet* -- the Panchanga Nirnayak Samiti sets them
astronomically and releases them roughly a year ahead. This module fills that
gap by **computing** them, so a project can keep working past the verified
horizon. What it returns is a prediction, not a fact.

How good is the prediction?
---------------------------
Measured against the 110 verified years (1975-2084 BS), a self-check anyone can
re-run via :func:`validate`:

* **~87% of months** get the exact right length;
* **the rest are wrong by exactly one day** -- never more;
* only about **53% of years** come out completely correct.

That residual is not a bug to be tuned away. The Bikram Sambat month boundary is
the instant the true sun (by Surya-Siddhanta reckoning) crosses into the next
sidereal sign, assigned to a civil day by a traditional rule, and the official
committee occasionally applies manual corrections. An independent computation
using the same Surya-Siddhanta model still lands one day to either side of the
official value about one month in eight. Modern-astronomy models (Meeus + a
Lahiri ayanamsa) do *worse* here -- ~73% -- precisely because the calendar is
not defined by modern astronomy.

What this means for you
-----------------------
* **Never treat a predicted date as authoritative.** A due date, a legal
  deadline, an invoice date past the verified range can be off by a day.
* **Do use it for planning and display** where a one-day slip is tolerable, and
  replace it with verified rows the moment the Samiti publishes them.
* Predicted years are **not installed into the calendar automatically**. Every
  BS date this package produces stays verified unless you opt in by hand -- see
  :func:`build_provisional_table` and the ``PROVISIONAL_BS_MONTH_DAYS`` note in
  :mod:`django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data`. When a predicted year *is* installed, using
  it raises :class:`~django_bikram_sambat.exceptions.ProvisionalDateWarning`.

The model
---------
Surya-Siddhanta mean solar longitude with the classical manda (equation of
centre) correction, crossed against the twelve sidereal signs, with the sign
ingress assigned to a Nepal civil day by a fixed near-midnight threshold. The
two free constants (:data:`_AYANAMSA_FIT` and :data:`_DAY_THRESHOLD_HOURS`) were
fit to the verified range; they are documented, not magic, and re-fitting them
cannot push past the ~87% ceiling above.
