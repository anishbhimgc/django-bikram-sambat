"""Exception hierarchy for :mod:`django_bikram_sambat`.

The hierarchy is deliberately shallow::

    BikramError
    └── InvalidBSDate  (also a ValueError)
        └── DateOutOfRange

:class:`InvalidBSDate` subclasses :exc:`ValueError` as well as
:class:`BikramError`. That is not an accident: callers who already write
``except ValueError`` around date parsing -- and every Django/DRF ``to_python``
in the wild does -- keep working, while callers who want to catch exactly this
package's failures can say ``except BikramError``.
