"""Nepali fiscal year and quarter arithmetic.

Nepal's fiscal year (आर्थिक वर्ष) runs **1 Shrawan through the last day of
Ashadh** -- month 4 of one Bikram Sambat year to month 3 of the next. It is
named for the year it *starts* in, written with the ending year's last two
digits: the year beginning 1 Shrawan 2081 is **FY 2081/82**.

Everything here derives from that one rule, so there is no second calendar table
to keep in step with :mod:`django_bikram_sambat.calendar_data`.

Why this is not a "just add 3 months" helper
--------------------------------------------
The fiscal year is a contiguous span of days, and the only correct way to select
it from a database is a half-open range over the indexed column -- exactly as for
a BS year. :func:`fiscal_year_bounds` returns those Gregorian bounds;
:func:`django_bikram_sambat.django.lookups.bs_fiscal_year_q` wraps them in a ``Q``.
Deriving a fiscal year *per row* in SQL would need the BS calendar table inlined
into the query, with the same sequential-scan cost documented in
:mod:`django_bikram_sambat.django.lookups`.

Quarters follow the Nepali government's convention, which is simply the fiscal
year cut into four three-month blocks:

======  ==========================================  ==============
Q1      Shrawan, Bhadra, Ashwin (months 4-6)        first quarter
Q2      Kartik, Mangsir, Poush (months 7-9)         second quarter
Q3      Magh, Falgun, Chaitra (months 10-12)        third quarter
Q4      Baishakh, Jestha, Ashadh (months 1-3)       fourth quarter
======  ==========================================  ==============

Note that Q4 is the *earlier* part of the BS year: Baishakh 2082 belongs to
FY 2081/82, not FY 2082/83.
